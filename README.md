# Employee Attendance Management System
*Simplifying attendance tracking with secure authentication and dashboards.*

## Overview
The Employee Attendance Management System is a comprehensive solution to manage employee attendance, leave requests, and related operations. The project integrates secure login, role-based dashboards, and detailed activity flows illustrated via UML diagrams. It is designed to cater to businesses and developers who require a scalable and reliable attendance tracking system with a modern technology stack.

## Key Features
- **Secure Authentication:** Robust login and session management.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for managers, employees, and administrators.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Efficient capturing and reporting of attendance data.
- **Leave Management:** Streamlined request, approval, and tracking of leaves.
- **Detailed UML Documentation:** Clear, professional sequence diagrams for system processes.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React/Vue/Angular as optional)
- **Backend:** Node.js (v14+), Express.js
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** JWT-based secure sessions
- **Documentation:** UML diagrams generated with draw.io

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/muhammadhamzagova666/Attendance-Management-System.git
   cd Attendance-Management-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with content similar to:
   ```
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASS=your_db_password
   DB_NAME=attendance_db
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   PORT=3000
   ```
4. **Database Setup:**
   Import the provided SQL schema from `Source/employeems.sql` to set up your database.
5. **Start the Application:**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Guide
- **Login:** Access the login page via your configured URL.
- **Dashboards:** Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the applicable dashboard based on your role.
- **API Endpoints:** Refer to the API documentation for endpoints related to attendance, leaves, and user management.
- **UML Documentation:** Detailed UML Sequence Diagrams are available in the `UML Diagrams/Sequence Diagrams/` directory.

## Configuration & Environment Variables
- Use the `.env` file to set up database credentials and server configurations.
- Example:
  ```
  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USER=root
  DB_PASS=password123
  DB_NAME=attendance_db
  JWT_SECRET=mysecretkey
  PORT=3000
  ```

## Deployment Guide
- **Docker Deployment:** Create a Dockerfile to containerize your application.
- **Kubernetes:** Configure your deployment YAML files for Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Cloud Services:** Deploy on your platform of choice (AWS, Azure, GCP) by following their Node.js application guidelines.

## Testing & Debugging
- **Running Tests:** Use the command below to run unit/integration tests:
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```
- **Debug Tips:** Check the logs in the integrated terminal. Ensure your environment variables are correctly set, and database connectivity is established.

## Performance Optimization
- Leverage database indexing and caching mechanisms.
- Optimize API endpoints by monitoring performance and response times.
- Use load balancing in production.

## Security Best Practices
- Implement HTTPS in production.
- Regularly update dependencies and conduct vulnerability scans.
